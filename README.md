# page_routing_app

This is a Flutter project extended from [Flutter-go_router](https://github.com/ChiekoN/Flutter-go_router) project.

In the previous project, I explored how to implement **navigation and routing** in Flutter, by creating a very simple app that just lists some "important day" dates.

This time, I've added more functions and improvements, making it one (tiny) step closer to a real-world app. 
 - Created an actual form in Add Page where we can add a new item to the list.
 - Created a widget for Detail Page where we can see more information of the item.
 - Added a function to delete items from the list.
 - Added filters so that:
   - Top page shows the list that has only future dates (including today)
   - History page shows the list for past dates

## Objective

To achieve these minimal but fundamental functionalities, **state management** is crucial. 

I first learned Flutter's primitive state management such as using a Stateful Widget. 

(See [State management (Flatter Docs)](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/fundamentals/state-management))

Then I explored [Bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/) state management library which is suitable for more complex state management.

In this app, I implemented `Bloc` (more precisely, `Cubit`) to handle the change of list items. Additionally, `Stateful Widget` is used to handle input values on the form.


## State management using Bloc/Cubit

  These YouTube tutorials by [Mitch Koko](https://www.youtube.com/@createdbykoko) are great! It helped me to grab the concept of Bloc and how to write clean and organised codeâœ¨


## Code

Source code is organised like this:

```

 â”£ domain  // represents domain layer
 â”ƒ â”£ models
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— todate.dart
 â”ƒ â”— repository

## Platform

In develpment, I selected Windows app as my target device.
